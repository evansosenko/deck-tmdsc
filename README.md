## Description

Superconducting phases of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides.
Contributed Talk, 2016 APS March Meeting.

## Quickstart

```
$ git clone https://github.com/evansosenko/deck-tmdsc.git
$ cd deck-tmdsc
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Building and Development

### Source Code

The [deck-tmdsc source] is hosted on GitHub.
Clone the project with

```
$ git clone https://github.com/evansosenko/deck-tmdsc.git
```

[deck-tmdsc source]: https://github.com/evansosenko/deck-tmdsc

### Requirements

You will need [Node.js] with [npm].

Install the development dependencies with

```
$ npm install
```

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/

#### Updating requirements

Requirements are version-locked to ensure consistent deploys.

To use the newest allowed Node packages,
or after updating any package versions in `package.json`,
update and stage `npm-shrinkwrap.json` with

```
$ npm update
$ npm shrinkwrap --dev
$ git add npm-shrinkwrap.json
```

### Tasks

Primary development tasks are defined under `scripts` in `package.json`
and available via `npm run-script`.
View them with

```
$ npm run
```

#### Production Build

Lint, test, generate, and optimize the production build to `public` with

```
$ npm run dist
```

#### Deploy to GitHub Pages

Build and deploy to GitHub Pages with

```
$ npm run deploy
```

The following environment variables can be set to customize the deploy:
`DEPLOY_REPO`, `DEPLOY_BRANCH`, `DEPLOY_NAME`, and `DEPLOY_EMAIL`.

##### Deploy from wrecker

Create a new wercker SSH key with the name `DEPLOY`,
add it to a new wercker deploy step,
and add it to the GitHub repository as a deploy key with write access.

#### Brunch

[Brunch] is responsible for the development cycle
and the production build.

Start a local Brunch development server with

```
$ npm start
```

If installed globally, `brunch` may be invoked directly.
View available commands with

```
$ brunch
```

#### gulp

Linting, deployment, and optimization is handled by [gulp].

In a separate window, use gulp to watch for changes
and lint HTML, JavaScript, and Sass files with

```
$ npm run watch
```

If installed globally, `gulp` may be invoked directly.
View available commands with

```
$ gulp --tasks
```

[gulp]: http://gulpjs.com/

## Tips for Deck Makers

### Bespoke.js

The [Bespoke.js GitHub page] covers how to make a deck.

Put slides in `app/partials/slides.static.hbs`, e.g.,

```html
<section>Slide 1</section>
<section>Slide 2</section>
<section>Slide 3</section>
```

[Bespoke.js GitHub page]: https://github.com/bespokejs/bespoke

### Plugins, Themes, and Libraries

- Install plugins, themes, and any other front end dependencies,
  e.g., JavaScript modules, Sass libraries, fonts, etc.,
  with `npm i --save`.
- Use JavaScript modules directly with `import`.
- Bespoke.js is configured in `app/modules/deck.js`.
- The `node_modules` directory exists in the Sass include path
  via the setting in `brunch-config.coffee`.
- Use `app/styles/main.scss` as the entry point for your styles.
- All other assets may be placed under `app/assets`.
- Wrap asset paths referenced in your markup
  with `DIGEST` for cache busting support.

### Meta Data

Meta data is defined in `app/index.static.hbs`.

- Nil values are indicated by a `~`.
  Nil fields never generate a meta tag.
  Fields which are Nil by default are generally optional.
- The `image`, `audio`, and `video` fields must be given
  as a fully qualified url.
  The recommended way to specify this value is with `DIGEST`, e.g.,
  assuming `app/assets/images/logo.png` exists,
  use `image: DIGEST(/images/logo.png)`.
- Instead of the `video` field, you may specify a `youtube` video id.
- The `twitter` fields are used for [Twitter Cards], but you must
  enable them for your domain with Twitter first.
